# Generation and checking of special types of matrices

This class is to generate and check some special types of matrices.

The MatrixCheck class contains methods to check if a given matrix is a of particular type. For example, if a 3 by 3 matrix R is a rotational matrix or not, i.e R'R=I and det(R)=1.

The MatrixGeneration class contains methods to generate matrices of special types. For example, generating a 3 by 3 matrix random rotation matrix.
