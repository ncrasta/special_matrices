# How to generate or check some special types of matrices?

The `MatrixCheck` class contains methods to check if a given matrix is a of particular type. For example, if a `3x3` matrix `R` is a rotational matrix or not, i.e `R'R=I and det(R)=1`

The `MatrixGeneration` class contains methods to generate matrices of special types. For example, generating a `3x3` matrix random rotation matrix.
